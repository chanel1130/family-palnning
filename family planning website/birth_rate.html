      <p class="mainText"> In recent years, China has shifted from the One-Child Policy to the Two-Child Policy in 2016 and the Three-Child Policy in 2021. However, like many countries in the world, the birth rate in China continues to go down, even with the relief in policies. Based on Yun et al in Birth Rate Transition in the Republic of Korea: Trends and Prospects, the causes of an aging and low-fertility society include intensifying competition for employment and education, rise in housing prices and decrease in consumer spending capacity, gender discrimination at the workplace, care gap in the care infrastructure system, and so on. Creating an environment “where people work together and take care of each other” by relieving the problems mentioned above becomes the key to altering an aging society.</p>
